          The Affordance Constraint: Agency, Accountability, and the Ontological Limits of LLMs in Education
        </div>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          This paper argues that large language models cannot replace human teachers because they lack the epistemic standing
          and moral accountability required for genuine pedagogy. Using a framework of pedagogical affordances, the analysis
          demonstrates that teaching depends on three fundamental capacities: theory of mind and student modeling, hierarchical
          agency and long-term planning, and moral accountability in testimony. Although AI systems can simulate the surface
          forms of explanation and feedback, they cannot instantiate the relational, normative, and epistemic conditions that
          make teaching possible. The proper role of AI in education is therefore instrumental rather than authoritative.
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The integration of artificial intelligence into education raises a question that is epistemic before it is operational:
          what is the status of AI as a source of knowledge? Can a large language model (LLM) function as a teacher, or does
          treating it as one commit a category error that conflates performance with competence?
        </p>

        <p>
          This inquiry is not speculative. Institutions are actively experimenting with AI-led instructional models, deploying
          systems marketed not merely as repositories of information but as pedagogical agents capable of personalization,
          diagnosis, and guidance. The empirical literature on Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) supports some optimism in
          procedural domains. VanLehn’s meta-analysis suggests that well-designed ITS can approach human tutoring effectiveness
          in well-structured settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          This efficacy is constrained by a distinction between procedural gains and epistemic teaching. Many success cases are
          concentrated in domains where knowledge is algorithmic and answers are binary. Yet education also involves conceptual
          understanding, critical judgment, and the development of epistemic agency.
        </p>

        <p>
          I argue that these limitations are not temporary technical shortcomings or artifacts of current error rates. They arise
          from architectural and philosophical constraints that follow from the nature of LLMs and from the requirements of teaching.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope and Approach</h2>
        <p>
          This paper evaluates the strongest claim: that LLMs could serve as complete replacements for human teachers, occupying
          equivalent epistemic roles and assuming comparable responsibilities. This replacement model is analytically distinct from
          course-helper and hybrid models where humans retain epistemic authority.
        </p>

        <h2>Pedagogical Affordances</h2>
        <p>
          I introduce pedagogical affordances as an intermediate level of analysis: relational possibilities for warranted belief
          formation made available by an instructional arrangement. On this view, teaching succeeds by configuring conditions under
          which understanding can emerge, not merely by presenting information.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          What kinds of epistemically justified learning become possible for this learner, in this environment, under this instructional structure?
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Three Core Pedagogical Affordances</h2>

        <h3>Theory of mind and student modeling</h3>
        <p>
          Effective teaching depends on structured, evolving models of learners’ knowledge states and misconceptions. Teachers infer
          why errors occur, update their models over time, and draw on cues that are not reducible to the textual trace of an answer.
          LLMs can simulate personalization, but they do not maintain stable, queryable models of a student as a thinker.
        </p>

        <h3>Hierarchical agency and planning</h3>
        <p>
          Teaching is teleological: it is organized around long-term objectives and the sequencing constraints of concept dependencies.
          Teachers maintain nested intentions and preserve coherence across weeks and months. LLM behavior is optimized locally for
          next-token continuation; long-horizon pedagogical agency is not an internal feature of the system.
        </p>

        <h3>Moral accountability and testimony</h3>
        <p>
          Much teaching works through testimony and challenge. For testimony to function epistemically, speakers must be accountable
          for what they assert. Human teachers can be challenged, corrected, sanctioned, and required to justify claims. LLM outputs
          may be useful, but the system does not bear responsibility in the way an educator does.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The practical implication is not abstinence, but division of labor. LLMs can be valuable auxiliaries for retrieval,
          variation, and low-stakes practice, while epistemic authority and responsibility remain with human educators. That boundary
          is not merely a quality gap. It reflects what it is to teach.
        </p>
